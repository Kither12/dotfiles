# Kither's dotfiles
My dotfiles for a great tiling window manger experience on Arch Linux with i3wm. As the main theme of the system and all programs, I chose the gruvbox because of the pleasant palette for me and the absence of acidic colors. And last but not least, Kessoku band is actually so good.
